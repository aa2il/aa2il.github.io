    <p>Thanks for stopping by. I was originally licensed in the late
      1970's as a teenager. After 35+ years as a professional electrical
      engineer, I recently retired and get to play radio a lot more these
      days. One of the many activities I enjoy is developing applications
      related to ham radio. This repository contains the source code for
      the applications I regularly use are are being made available in the
      hope that fellow hams might find some of these useful as well. </p>

    <p>This website is under-construction and will eventually be used to
      document this suite of codes. </p>
